# hexed2
based on https://github.com/Anuken/HexedPlugin

### servercommands
* `hexed`: generates a normal hexed map
* `hexed14`: generates a hexed map for max 14 players
* `hexed <w> <h>`: generates a hexed map with custom width and height ~ not recommended

### extra
This plugin automatically disables `hails, ripples`.

### known bug
Don't use the hexed command directly after each other.
You need to close the connection first with stop!

### auto restart
You will need a batch script to restart the server.
